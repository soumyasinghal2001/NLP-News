# 📰 NLP-News: News Article Classification using NLP

This project implements a **supervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline** to **classify news articles into categories based on textual content**.
It demonstrates how raw, unstructured text data can be transformed into numerical features and used for **machine learning–based text classification**.

---

## 📌 Project Description

News articles contain large amounts of unstructured text.
The objective of this project is to build a **news classification system** using classical NLP and machine learning techniques that can automatically learn patterns from text and assign the correct label/category.

The entire workflow — from preprocessing to evaluation — is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧠 Methodology

The project follows a standard NLP classification pipeline:

### 1. Data Loading

* News articles and labels loaded from a JSON dataset

### 2. Text Preprocessing

* Lowercasing
* Removal of punctuation and special characters
* Tokenization
* Stopword removal
* Text normalization

### 3. Feature Extraction

* Text converted into numerical vectors using **Bag of Words / TF-IDF**
* Enables machine learning models to process text data

### 4. Model Training

* Supervised classification model trained on labeled data
* Train–test split used for evaluation

### 5. Model Evaluation

* Predictions generated on unseen test data
* Performance measured using classification metrics
